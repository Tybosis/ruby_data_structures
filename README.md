# Data Structures

by Tyler Pottle

## Description

This project is a representation of various data structures implemented
in Ruby.

### Linked Lists

The linked list file contains my version of a linked list written in
ruby.  I created a list class, which is initialized with one node
object, but more node objects can be added.  A node object simply
holds a value and a reference to the next node object in the linked list.
I also included methods to remove a node from the list, search for a
specific node by value, and also a to_s method to return a string
comprised of all the values of nodes in the linked list, separated by
a comma.

My sources to write this linked list program were as follows:
